<h1 align="center">Countdown Timer</h1>

Countdown created with HTMl, CSS and JavaScript, inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtKciwk_si4&t=1033s">this project here</a> And I loved doing this project, because I'm actually going to travel to Yerevan in September and I didn't know how much temp was left, it's going to be a big help! I learned a lot about functions in this project, after all it was the first one that decided to use js. And even in CSS, first time I used background: url() so it was very productive to learn new CSS functions.</a>.
